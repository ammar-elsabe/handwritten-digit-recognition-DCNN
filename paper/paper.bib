  abstract = {Multilayer neural networks trained with the back-propagation algorithm constitute the best example of a successful gradient based learning technique. Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day.},

We propose a cluster-based tree algorithm to accelerate k-NN classification without any presuppositions about the metric form and properties of a dissimilarity measure. A mechanism of early decision making and minimal side-operations for choosing searching paths largely contribute to the efficiency of the algorithm. The algorithm is evaluated through extensive experiments over standard NIST and MNIST databases.},

  abstract = {An error matrix is frequently employed to organize and display information used to assess the thematic accuracy of a land-cover map, and numerous accuracy measures have been proposed for summarizing the information contained in this error matrix. No one measure is universally best for all accuracy assessment objectives, and different accuracy measures may lead to conflicting conclusions because the measures do not represent accuracy in the same tray. Choosing appropriate accuracy measures that address objectives of the mapping project is critical. Characteristics of some commonly used accuracy measures are described, and relationships among these measures are provided to aid the user in choosing an appropriate measure. Accuracy measures that are directly interpretable as probabilities of encountering certain types of misclassification errors or correct classifications should be selected in. preference to measures not interpretable as such. User's and producer's accuracy and the overall proportion OF area correctly classified are examples of accuracy measures possessing the desired probabilistic interpretation. The kappa coefficient of agreement does not possess such a probabilistic interpretation because of the adjustment for hypothetical chance agreement incorporated into this measure, and the strong dependence of kappa on the marginal proportions of the error matrix makes the utility of kappa for comparisons suspect. Normalizing an error matrix results in estimates that are not consistent for accuracy paramteters of the map being assessed, so that this procedure is generally not warranted for most applications.},

  abstract = {Given the ubiquity of handwritten documents in human transactions, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) of documents have invaluable practical worth. Optical character recognition is a science that enables to translate various types of documents or images into analyzable, editable and searchable data. During last decade, researchers have used artificial intelligence/machine learning tools to automatically analyze handwritten and printed documents in order to convert them into electronic format. The objective of this review paper is to summarize research that has been conducted on character recognition of handwritten documents and to provide research directions. In this Systematic Literature Review (SLR) we collected, synthesized and analyzed research articles on the topic of handwritten OCR (and closely related topics) which were published between year 2000 to 2019. We followed widely used electronic databases by following pre-defined review protocol. Articles were searched using keywords, forward reference searching and backward reference searching in order to search all the articles related to the topic. After carefully following study selection process 176 articles were selected for this SLR. This review article serves the purpose of presenting state of the art results and techniques on OCR and also provide research directions by highlighting research gaps.},

  abstract = {Handwriting is a common, natural form of communication for humans, and therefore it is useful to utilize this modality as a means of input to machines. One well-known method of classifying individual characters or words is template matching. We demonstrate a template-based system for online character recognition where the number of representative templates is determined automatically. These templates can be viewed as representing different styles of writing a particular character. The templates are then used as a reference for efficient classification using decision trees. Overall, our classifier achieves an 86.9% accuracy on a set of 17,928 alphanumeric characters (36 classes; 10 digits and 26 lowercase letters) with a throughput of over 8 characters per second on a 296 MHz Sun UltraSparc.},

Small (often minimal) receptive fields of convolutional winner-take-all neurons yield large network depth, resulting in roughly as many sparsely connected neural layers as found in mammals between retina and visual cortex. Only winner neurons are trained. Several deep neural columns become experts on inputs preprocessed in different ways; their predictions are averaged. Graphics cards allow for fast training. On the very competitive MNIST handwriting benchmark, our method is the first to achieve near-human performance. On a traffic sign recognition benchmark it outperforms humans by a factor of two. We also improve the state-of-the-art on a plethora of common image classification benchmarks.},
